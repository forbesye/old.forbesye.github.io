 I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Science, graduating in December 2021. I'm particularly interested in full-stack web and app development, distributed systems, and the effects of technology on culture and society.

 In my free time, I enjoy running, lifting, cooking, and listening to audiobooks and podcasts!

 I am planning on thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail starting in March 2022 and hopefully finishing around September/October. I'm currently seeking any full-time software engineering positions starting in Fall 2022!
