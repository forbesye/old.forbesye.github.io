 I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Science. I'm particularly interested in full-stack web and app development, distributed systems, and the effects of technology on culture and society.

 In my free time, I enjoy running, lifting, cooking, and listening to audiobooks and podcasts!
