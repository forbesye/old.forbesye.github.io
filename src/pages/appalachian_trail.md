The [Appalachian Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Trail) is a ~2,200 mile trail that goes from Georgia to Maine. I plan on hiking the entire thing in one go, which is called a [thru-hike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thru-hiking). I'll be starting on March 22, 2022 and (hopefully) finishing sometime before October 3, 2022.

I'll be posting blog posts on this site as I go, for the following reasons:

- To keep my friends, family, and whoever else is reading this updated on my status and all the interesting/not-interesting things I'll be doing.
- A lot of previous thru-hikers said they regret not keeping a record of their thru-hike that they can look back on after they finish.

I won't have cell service all the time, so there probably be a delay between me writing my posts and them being published here.

I didn't want to be basic and use Wordpress or some other platform to set up this website and blog. Because of my hubris, it took me a hot minute to create this site and get a proper workflow/deployment pipeline that would work with only access to my phone. I'll write a post in the future about how I got this working.

I also set up a nifty map with markers of where I write each blog post, which you can see below:

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why tho?**

I don't really have a good answer besides that I read about it and thought it would be a fun and exciting challenge. I've always felt much more at peace when I'm in nature. Additionally, the gap I have between graduating college and starting work is probably one of the best times in my life for me to attempt this. I would have to otherwise quit my job or beg for a six month leave of absence.

**How long will this take you?**

It's kinda hard to know exactly how many days it will take, as so many things could happen that would affect how many miles I do in a day. The typical range is 4-7 months. I have [exactly 194 days (6 months and 10 days)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=days+from+3%2F23%2F2022+to+10%2F3%2F2022) from my start date to the first day of my job.

2,220 miles in 194 days puts me at roughly 11 miles a day without including rest days, which I'm fairly confident I can accomplish with my current level of physical conditioning, barring any significant incidents.

**Are you going _alone_?**

Technically, yeah, but there's about 3,000 other people that attempt to thru-hike the AT every year. My start date is in the ["bubble"](https://www.wherearethehikers.com/heatmap/) of hikers, so I'll rarely spend a day not seeing at least one person.

**Where are you sleeping at night?**

Most nights, in the tent I'm carrying (don't ask about how much it cost... [DCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyneema_Composite_Fabric) is an expensive material). The [AT also has a bunch of shelters](https://tnlandforms.us/at/) along the way, but they can get really crowded and I don't want rats running over my face when I sleep. I'll also be sleeping in hotels and hostels when I stop in town.

**What about bears, snakes, and [insert dangerous creature here]?**

The AT only has black bears, which are basically large racoons. They don't really approach humans, unless they're in a place where humans carelessly leave food around and the bears have associated us with delicious human food. I'll be fine as long as I have good situational awareness, store my food properly, and don't end up between a mama bear and her cub.

Most snakes are non-venomous and venomous snake bite hospitalizations are disproportionately young, drunk men (I wonder why!). I don't really drink all that much or often and I think my sense of self-preservation is good enough to where I won't do dumb shenanigans with snakes.

Realistically, what I'm most afraid of is getting Lyme disease from a tick. This risk can be largely mitigated by treating my clothes with permethrin and giving myself daily tick checks. You're only really at risk for getting Lyme disease if a tick is burrowed in you for more than 24 hours.

Other risks that I need to watch out for are overuse injuries, rolling my ankles, and contracting giardia or norovirus. I've been physically training to reduce the risk of the first two, and I'll be carrying a water filter for the last one.

**How are you going to carry all your food with you?**

While I do wish I have the leg strength to carry 2,200 miles worth of calories, I'll be stopping in towns every couple of days to resupply. Hikers resupply with a combination of buying food from grocery stores in town and shipping packages to these towns (thanks mom!).

Thru-hiker diets are notoriously full of processed and sugary foods (e.g. ramen and candy bars) due to the fact that we need to carry lightweight, shelf-stable foods on our backs. I'll try to eat lots of fruits and veggies when I stop in towns.

**Have you thought about bringing \_\_\_\_\_\_?**

[Yes, very extensively.](https://lighterpack.com/r/21f9sh)

**What are the odds you'll actually finish this?**

The rough stats are that only 25% of thru-hikers actually finish the AT. However, I think I've put in a lot of preparation towards my attempt so far.
