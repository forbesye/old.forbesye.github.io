### **What did you like least about the class?**

I thought the disconnect between lectures and projects was a bit too much at times. At times it felt like I was taking a class for advanced Python and intro to SQL rather than software engineering. I understand the Downing wants there to be a disconnect, but I feel that a few lectures going over topics more directly related to software development methodologies outside of refactoring would have been beneficial.

### **What did you like the most about the class?**

I really liked the autonomy we were given with the project. Every other assignment/project I've done in my CS curriculum so far has felt constraining. I really appreciated that we were allowed to use tools and technologies that weren't listed. The amount of creative freedom is something that is not really seen in that many other CS courses.

### **What's the most significant thing you learned?**

How to work with a group, often in an asynchronous manner. I felt that my group was able to effectively get our work done through our use of disciplined use of GitLab issues, Slack, and other communication methods. I've had previous projects where we tried to delegate work through a single group text, and let me tell you I learned my lesson **not** to do that again. The Agile style board our group had on GitLab issues allowed us to easily see what tasks we had to do, what was currently being worked on, and the tasks we already finished.

### **How many hours a week did you spend coding/debugging/testing for this class?**

Anywhere from 5-20 hours depending on the workload. Phase II and III were definitely the most intensive, but overall I felt that I wasn't overly stressed by time constraints.

### **How many hours a week did you spend reading/studying for this class?**

Probably around an hour or two a week looking over the assigned papers and previous lectures. I spent more time the week before both exams going over the HackerRanks that we did in class.

### **How many lines of code do you think you wrote?**

If I had to guess, around 3,000-4,000 lines over the entire semester.

### **What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?**

GitLab CI/CD integration with AWS! It felt really powerful to be able to commit/merge to a branch and have an entire testing suite and deployment pipeline go off.

### **Whatâ€™s the most useful web dev tool that your group used that was not required?**

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for our front-end code formatting was really useful! If only we found out about it earlier... Just like Black for Python, it formats our entire front-end codebase in one command. There's also a nifty extension for VSCode and other text editors that auto-formats on save, so you don't even have to worry about running the command. It let's our merge requests be focused completely on changes in logic in our code, rather than having style changes included.

### **How did you feel about your group having to self-teach many, many technologies?**

I found it to be a fun challenge, and representative to what we'll have to deal with in our future careers. I believe that being able to go through documentation and get a grasp of what's going on is a highly valuable skill in the software development industry.

### **How did you feel about the two-stage quizzes and tests?**

I felt that the two-stage quizzes were much more useful than the two-stage tests. With the quizzes, our group discussed more about why we missed the questions and why the correct answer is right. However, with the tests, we were so focused on getting everything correct (due to the much greater weight of the situation) that it kind of turned into a copypasta session from whoever got it right.

### **How did you feel about the cold calling, in the end?**

It wasn't bad at all. However, I always got a little heart attack whenever I heard the "J" syllable come from Downing's mouth whenever he said someones name.
