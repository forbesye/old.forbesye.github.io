I did feel that some of it was a bit shoehorned at the end. However, the weekly readings throughout the semester were invaluable for delving into these ideas in a deeper manner.</p>\n<h3><strong>Were there any other particular takeaways for you?</strong></h3>\n<p>The importance of knowing how to work with a group! I felt that my group was able to effectively get our work done through our use of disciplined use of GitLab issues, Slack, and other communication methods. I've had previous projects where we tried to delegate work through a single group text, and let me tell you I learned my lesson to <em><strong>not</strong></em> do that again. The Scrum-style board our group had on GitLab issues allowed us to easily see what tasks we had to do, what was currently being worked on, and the tasks we already finished.</p>\n<h3><strong>How did you feel about two-stage quizzes and tests?</strong></h3>\n<p>Overall, I felt that it was beneficial to us. It allowed us to first test our own knowledge of a certain topic, then fill in gaps of information or misconceptions that we had with the help of our teammates. My only issue with the quizzes were that they took close to 20% of a lecture's time on a given day.</p>\n<h3><strong>How did you feel about the cold calling?</strong></h3>\n<p>It wasn't too bad! However, I got a little spike of anxiety whenever I heard the \"J\" syllable come first from Downing's mouth when he called a name.</p>\n<h3><strong>How did you feel about office hours and lab sessions?</strong></h3>\n<p>I found the ones that I visited to be helpful in clearing up things I misunderstood and helped guide my group and I in a better direction.</p>\n<h3><strong>Give me your suggestions for improving the course</strong></h3>\n<p>I thought the disconnect between lectures and projects was a bit too much at times. At times it felt like I was taking a class for advanced Python and intro to SQL rather than software engineering. I understand the Downing wants there to be a disconnect, but I feel that a few lectures going over topics more directly related to software development methodologies outside of refactoring would have been beneficial.</p>\n<h3><strong>To future students</strong></h3>\n<p>This is probably the most valuable class in the CS department to gain knowledge about many tools and processes used in software development. It's a high workload, but I guarantee if you put in the time and effort, that you'll be greatly rewarded!</p>","excerpt":"Key Takeaways Test first, test during, test after, test, test, test When designing algorithms, demand the weakest capabilities (e.gâ€¦"}},"pageContext":{"type":"posts","next":null,"previous":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1425477374","3128451518"]}
